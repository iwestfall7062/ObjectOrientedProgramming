//Create a complete Java program that counts the number of lines and words (space-separated tokens) in all of the .txt
//files (regardless of case) in the program's working directory. Your program should print the counts for each text
//file (i.e. print the name of the file and the counts) and print the total counts for all of the files read. If your
//program encounters an error it should stop reading that file, discard the counts for that file, print an error
//message, and move on the next file.
