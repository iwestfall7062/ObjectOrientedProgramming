//Write a program that reads data about the changing popularity of baby names and displays the data about a particular
//name. Prompt the user for a name and gender. The data files for this project can be found at
//www.ssa.gov/oact/babynames/limits.html. The data files are named for the year of birth e.g. the file yob1992.txt has
//data for the year 1992. Each line a data file has a name, gender, and number in a comma-separated list. For example:
//
//Jennifer,F,56709
//
//Display a nicely formatted table that shows the changing popularity of the name the user entered over time. Think
//about what would make a good measure of popularity over time. Your program should start with a welcome message
//explaining the program and how it measures popularity. Also, display the year(s) with highest and lowest popularity.
//Do not include the data files in your submission. You may assume that your program will be run inside of a folder with
//all of the data files. Do not assume what years of data will be given (i.e. I may test on a subset of the data or use
//my own test files).
